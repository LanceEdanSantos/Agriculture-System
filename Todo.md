Sir Dom's recommendation 

In farmers web app the item requests No decimal in request form 

In the farmer system, Only specific farmer account will view their own request/history and will not be able to see other farmer request

In the farmer system, when creating a new item request, create a new field for stock to show how many stocks are in system and not place it beside the name of stock. (So another field for quantity sa remaining stocks). The Stock has to be label and not editable 

In inventory items tab, I bold Ang number sa available stocks sa inventory item. Para mas clear daw lantawun

In farms tab in categories, place something similar to a side bar or drop down for each category for easier viewing

OFFICE RECOMMENDATIONS 

In farms tab. Under the user table, add a phone num, then add associations (example For school) the associations would be like katong units/categories na pag mu type naa ray dropdown na predetermined and replace the role into descriptions, the edit and delete button change it into 3 dots.

in farms tab in the edit starting from farm information to users , ganahan Sila na Maka print/excel mabutang same ras inventory items 

In activity logs remove the type column

In Roles tab walaon Ang guard name then Ang edit and delete e 3 dots

In inventory items tab, Replace supplier with the description/notes, and after adding it Swap the description column with unit column

Remove all suppliers para ma usa Ang stocks Kay di needed Ang suppliers. So pag click atong create inventory item walaon natong suppliers information.

In inventory items tab kulang Ang filter ug dates(example by month ra)

In inventory items tabs pag click nimo sa deleted items walay mu gawas na information, pag e click nimo mu gawas Ang (404 error)

In item requests tab, place like a note so that the admin can explain the availability of the stock before approving. (For example ni request Ang farmer's ug 50 items pero Ang available is 30 ra, naay way na Maka communicate Sila na e pa dayun raba Ang request niya even if kulang) murag chatbox Ang gipangita lance ba

RECOMMENDATION FROM SIR PACTOL

Stock movements will be a history log instead


To option to move stocks in and out will be placed in inventory items beside the name


In stock movement change the word type to action


In stock movements, don't go to the "new stock movement" everything has to be in the same page. 


So the new stock movement will be like a button beside the item name in inventory items which will automatically place the name and user. Will only have to input the action if stock in and out and quantity
